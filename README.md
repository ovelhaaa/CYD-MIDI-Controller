- **KEYS** - Virtual piano keyboard with scale and key controls
- **BEATS** - 16-step sequencer with 4 tracks and tempo control
- **ZEN** - Ambient bouncing ball mode for generative music
- **DROP** - Physics-based ball drop with customizable platforms
- **RNG** - Random music generator for creative exploration
- **XY PAD** - Touch-controlled X/Y pad for real-time parameter control
- **ARP** - Arpeggiator with chord-based patterns
- **GRID** - Grid piano with 4ths layout for unique playing style
- **CHORD** - Auto-chord mode with diatonic chord progressions
- **LFO** - Low-frequency oscillator for modulation effects

### Core Features

- **Bluetooth MIDI** - Wireless connection to DAWs and music software
- **Touchscreen Interface** - Intuitive visual controls optimized for the CYD display
- **Real-time Control** - Low-latency MIDI output
- **Visual Feedback** - Responsive graphics

## What You Need

- **ESP32-2432S028R (CYD)** - ~$15 from AliExpress/Amazon
- Arduino IDE with ESP32 support

## PlatformIO Build

This project includes a PlatformIO environment for CYD boards that expose both
USB-C and Micro USB connectors:

```bash
pio run -e cyd-dual-usb
```

To upload, connect the board and run:

```bash
pio run -e cyd-dual-usb -t upload
```

The `cyd-usb-c` and `cyd-micro-usb` environments are kept as aliases and build
the same firmware, because the connector type does not change the ESP32 target.
This setup follows the dual-USB CYD configuration used by
[`ovelhaaa/beatCYDa`](https://github.com/ovelhaaa/beatCYDa/): `esp32dev`,
`espressif32@6.5.0`, `dio` flash at 40 MHz, and an ST7789 display setup. If your
board is an older single-USB ILI9341 CYD, change `User_Setup.h` back to
`ILI9341_2_DRIVER`.

```bash
pio run -e cyd-usb-c
pio run -e cyd-micro-usb -t upload
```

If upload fails, hold `BOOT` while PlatformIO starts connecting or try another USB
cable/port. The upload speed is set to `460800`, matching the known-good
dual-USB reference project; lower it to `115200` in `platformio.ini` if your USB
bridge is unreliable.

## Arduino IDE Installation

### 1. Add ESP32 Board Support
1. Go to `File` → `Preferences`
2. Add to "Additional Boards Manager URLs":
   ```
   https://espressif.github.io/arduino-esp32/package_esp32_index.json
   ```
3. Go to `Tools` → `Board` → `Boards Manager`
4. Search "ESP32" and install "ESP32 by Espressif Systems"

### 2. Install Libraries
In Arduino IDE Library Manager, install:
- `TFT_eSPI` by Bodmer
- `XPT2046_Touchscreen` by Paul Stoffregen

### 3. Configure TFT_eSPI
Replace the `libraries/TFT_eSPI/User_Setup.h` with the `User_Setup.h` from the repo.

### 4. Upload Code
1. Clone this repo and open `CYD_MIDI_Controller.ino`
2. Select board: `ESP32 Dev Module`
3. Connect CYD and upload
(Lower Upload Speed to `115200` if the sketch isn't uploading)

### 5. Connect
1. Pair "CYD MIDI" via Bluetooth
2. Select as MIDI input in your DAW

## Troubleshooting

- **Upload Speed**: Lower it to `115200` if the sketch isn't uploading
- **Blank screen**: Check TFT_eSPI pin configuration
- **No touch**: Verify touchscreen library installation
- **No Bluetooth**: Restart device and re-pair
